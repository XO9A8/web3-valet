# Web3 Valet — Voice-First Web3 Assistant

A modular, voice-first Web3 assistant platform that integrates voice interaction, decentralized identity, and NFT functionality — powered by **Rust**, **Node.js**, and **React**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Web3 Valet** is a multi-component system that enables users to interact with the blockchain using natural language and voice commands.  
It brings together speech processing, multi-agent orchestration, and on-chain operations (wallet, NFT minting, token transfers) through a unified backend and voice interface.

Unlike traditional assistants, Web3 Valet focuses on **voice-first decentralized interaction**, built from the ground up with extensibility, modularity, and EVM compatibility in mind.
